Business Case:
Problem Statement: The dilemma presents a choice between perusing through recipe collections, identifying an appropriate recipe that maximally utilizes available ingredients, and subsequently procuring the missing components, or alternatively resorting to food delivery services. The latter option, however, might not align with personal nutritional goals
